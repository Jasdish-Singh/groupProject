Dear Readers,One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them? 
Executive Editor John Morris sorts it out for you.

>
> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the

>
> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by

> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of

> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward
> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those
> that have not to implement reforms.
>
> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development
> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a
> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other
> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of
> the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.

> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the

> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic
> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,
> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant
> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in
> developing countries.
>
> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development
> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's
> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that
> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to
> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a

> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral
> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for
> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA

> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the
> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this
> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything
> that these institutions do.
>
> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in
> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants
> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,
> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with
> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA

> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development
> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private
> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support
> development projects that show results.
>
> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are
> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,
> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and
> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows
> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national
> security strategy.
>
> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor
> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics
> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be
> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the
> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest

> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than
> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the
> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.
>
> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of
> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources
> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States
> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20

Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002
The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data....http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,103259,00.asp

COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.
2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.

3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]A. It's a sailor's expression.We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.                        -----------Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadÃ³i"".Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).Sorry not to be able to be more definite!                        -----------Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few
years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics
research folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic
evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more
resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other
peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary
immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria
found around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of
people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular
basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of
the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that
they ""urbanized"" a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a
festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and
medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world
and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took
severe tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that
survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of
diseases over dozens of generations.What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's
most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically
European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment
that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other
parts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one
disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable
cornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the
mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the
world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their
genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted
some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.Cheers,-James Rogers

daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
system admin to upgrade the server.  With the ever changing face of spam,
this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up
to date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
www.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
about spyware and ""phoning home"", but in cases where the app needs to
access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal

> Hmm.  1. The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'.
2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even
if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite:
rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading
'%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow
the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval
the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.Confused?Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for
the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what
I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes:Line 46:
	- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config
only.Line 49:
	- bail on %files macro.Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro?Line 172-174:
	- add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track
	    %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib""
	  incompatibilities.I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it
appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:  1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If
     you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:     error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n
/usr/lib  2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later.> --

5236,"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
1997. Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

duly noteddefinately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?Later

2105,"Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.Cheers,

2053,"Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

RAH
http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-072302BJust Ask the Experts
By Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon 07/23/2002
In 2001 the National Science Foundation surveyed 1,500 people nationwide
and found that 77% believed that ""increased carbon dioxide and other gases
released into the atmosphere will, if unchecked, lead to global warming
..."" Yet half of those polled believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed
on Earth, despite the scientific fact that the dinosaurs went extinct tens
of millions of years before the earliest hominids appeared. Worse, only 22%
of the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide
- is.As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans
co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the
material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public
ignorance about scientific matters.Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from
television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about
global warming from human activities, no wonder most people ""believe"" that
global warming ""will"" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% ""worry
a great deal"" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13
environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those
polled, was polluted drinking water.So What Do We Know?Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are
three points we know from the science:   1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread
warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of
warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems
have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.      But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with
human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to
ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat)
and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain
glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago,
and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900
C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased
concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.
    # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude
that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth
must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one
to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from
weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last
two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface
temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made
greenhouse gases in the air.
    # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining
past climate or making projections for future trends.Future Shock: The ScenariosWhen it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say
about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(2000), ""Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They
are neither predictions nor forecasts."" Further, ""The possibility that any
single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly
uncertain,"" and finally, ""No judgement is offered in this Report as to the
preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities
of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations.""Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to
little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller
University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's "" ... 40 energy
scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way
and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively
they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics
strongly bias their projections.""Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first
step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first
uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate
simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate
forecast.Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate
simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results
because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements
of how the climate has changed in the last few decades.Complete SpeculationOn May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of
Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources, ""The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant
global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative.
Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently
involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen.""Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer
simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of
the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate
Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer
simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases
where good measurements are available:""For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ...
that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major
features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages
that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very
warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35
million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither
do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic
phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal
oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important
contributors to natural variability.""
Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000:""The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the
models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest
is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have.""
This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer
results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate
result.Think LocallyNow, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on
""highly uncertain"" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and
un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in
order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one
prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular
media, which would be where most people learn about the issue.The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies
expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002:""Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is
nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale
systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability...
Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more
occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated.""
The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, ""[T]here is currently
insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models
currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections.
For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes,
hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for
Policymakers, p. 15).""A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State
Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations:""Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales
of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such
predictions - called ""verification"" - is simply impossible, since we have
to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ...
climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future
variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing
season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones
and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more
significant impact on society than annual average global temperature
trends.""
On the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or
the experts?--

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

When it *is* working do a quick /sbin/lsmodand look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver').  Then put this on
a new line in /etc/modulesin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just domodprobe nvdriverto load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the
driver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the
nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not
open source).> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best

However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is
pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific
kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did).  As
debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package
and have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if
they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.Gavin--

 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.

   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.

someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""

spec file, which is now done :http://freshrpms.net/builds/gnuboy/gnuboy.specBasically, %doc is used to put files in %docdir (default to
/usr/share/docs/%{name}-%{version}/ and the listed files with relative
paths (i.e. that don't start with a ""/"") are relative to the %{builddir}
(the uncompressed source usually). So either you can choose to have a
""docs"" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting :
%doc docs
(or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory)
%doc docs/
Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} :
%doc docs/*Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not
already clear for you.
You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be
listed when using ""-qd"" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with
absolute filenames, for example :
%doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual
(this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file)
Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka
%{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc.> Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies?

without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for
(basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:)
then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm
put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package
need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those ""Requires:"" and rebuild a final version
of the package.
Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking
for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled,
BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel
Requires: gnome-libs
will be enough since they already depend on the ""lower level"" libs that are
glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf.> Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once
the %files error was corrected :rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course,
you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_
produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able
to finish successfully.Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because
entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really
installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're
writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-)It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables
during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install
DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the
unpacking and building processes.Matthias--

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Read it like this: new array with 1024 elements of type pointer to char.
As a pointer occupies the natural word size (32 bits or 64bits), no wonder
you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_elements).>  int len = sizeof(testbuff);

sizeof returns the size of types. You can use it with vars (and then the
normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're changing the
type with the var with a cast, of course you'll get the size of that new
type.Regards,

the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying

Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?==
http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",0

certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you
forward it using procmail or something like it).
 You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers. Not perfect, but better than what we have today.

As a practical matter, I doubt the value sold in such situations ever
adds up to the value lost.  And the non-pecuiary since of violation,
loss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.I don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this
situation.  We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.I'm not a lawyer either.  I played one on TV once but I didn't play a
very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's
'Takings'.  He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property
right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an
emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your
property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable
force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is
relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my
libertarian theology needed to be modified.He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might
not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.> -----Original Message-----

Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
programming syntax
to make sure people use loops or recursion?
<>Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?Hmm.I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep

You might join me for a weep.

Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ETBERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they

bar is pitch black.The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have

services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor

haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This

perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?Any ideas would be welcome.Thanks,

2051,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.htmlEvangelicals' threat to new archbishopDirect action threat over liberal views on sexualityStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
other people.  And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I
grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
wasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made
lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. 
Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It
isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
wealthy.

You are using a very narrow definition of ""smart"".  Smart doesn't make
you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
their energy elsewhere than being ""rich"".  But I don't know too many
really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
what wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
but with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  ""Old wealth"" is
incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
long-lived exceptions.It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
into it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
expend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are
wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
exaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those
people's lives ""fun"", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

Subject: employment market for applied cryptographers?On the employment situation... it seems that a lot of applied
cryptographers are currently unemployed (Tim Dierks, Joseph, a few
ex-colleagues, and friends who asked if I had any leads, the spate of
recent ""security consultant"" .sigs, plus I heard that a straw poll of
attenders at the codecon conference earlier this year showed close to
50% out of work).Are there any more definitive security industry stats?  Are applied
crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general
application programmers?  (From my statistically too small sample of
acquaintances it might appear so.)If this is so, why is it?- you might think the physical security push following the world
political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied
by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies
improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec
plans.- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national
information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security
Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought
to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's
best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's
security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium
which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control
points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play
for the home entertainment system space with DRM)However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though
there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term
unemployment rates were not that elevated in general)- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first
things to be canned when cash runs short?  - software security related contract employees laid off ahead of
full-timers?  Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and
especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between.  At
least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not
familiar with north america).- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated
expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI
companies downsizing.  (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption
of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509
delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was
strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I
think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of
the broken tech, people will just do something else.)- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps
weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers
with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging)
most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly
contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software.  So probably
failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of
financial incentives to care on the part of software developers.
Microsoft is really good at this one.  The number of times they
re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing!
Other explanations?  Statistics?  Sample-of-one stories?Adam
--
yes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have
been doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if
you have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference
commissions paid.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

Speech at TTI Vanguard: ""Designing for Resiliency"" 
Conference""911.net""by Bruce Sterling     Late last month I had the joy and privilege
of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer
scientists who were, basically, trying to find some 
reasons to live.    Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've
definitely got some reasons.    When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, 
with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where 
ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, 
well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle 
as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried 
away whenever I witness something like that.  They might 
well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing 
generally requires a reality check from some *other* 
conference.    So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly 
meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are 
my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, 
long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  
And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment 
of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very 
*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very 
hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,
yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  
So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with 
much better shoes.    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just 
deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of 
cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  
I have to report that when I took them my notes from the 
""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was 
bringing the noise.    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws 
drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the 
dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of 
the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the 
Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty 
broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they 
should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* 
stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in 
worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous 
computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this 
is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the 
future.     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all 
right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather 
harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is 
a similarly harsh, dark concept.    ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.   
The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D 
lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has 
been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, 
handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and 
opportunity to get any real-world traction.   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due 
to the events of September 11.  After that experience, 
ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had 
before.  And the means, although they are still 
speculative, are starting to make some sense.    What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?  
Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different 
technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off 
the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically 
impossible.    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are 
the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-
organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, 
embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with 
these things?    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical 
batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, 
power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells 
as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or 
aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; 
just something much, much better than today's batteries.  
Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,
entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously 
advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am 
about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's 
anything wrong with that!)    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have 
some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they 
had some powered processors in them.  Something internal, 
pervasive, a little computational action that is going on 
inside physical objects.    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close 
here.   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously 
underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the 
part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way 
to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The 
problem of the authorized user.  The authorized 
administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to 
play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the 
Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, 
it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected 
from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic 
infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in 
later, they are going to find out that they have 
inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster 
version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike 
information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a 
technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to 
make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our 
sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, 
like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, 
hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been 
there, done that.    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also 
underestimated, for when I started looking at serious 
applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping 
large amounts of physical material in and out of the 
ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, 
numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. 
Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, 
of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed 
fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, 
check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and 
flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self-
assembling networks: networks that are always 
reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.      Facial recognition has a considerable number of 
ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human 
presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware 
suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and 
weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major 
situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, 
environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric 
ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking 
them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from 
earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows 
for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you 
throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept 
here is that we are finally moving computation out of the 
ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the 
1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are 
deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the 
darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. 
That is 911.net.      Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very 
invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial 
design pals said about it, immediately, and they were 
right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for 
ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, 
because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain 
circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this 
issue.    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a 
pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much 
about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really 
want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct 
pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what 
911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its 
way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into 
daylight.       It is an emergency response system for the planet's 
open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are 
more of them all the time.    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp 
has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have 
dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of 
airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in 
airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, 
early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you 
can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital 
objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-
educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically 
under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly 
feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable 
people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some 
other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the 
GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace 
airports serve as political indoctrination centers that 
humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are 
meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of 
governmental clumsiness and general harm.    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that 
airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are 
hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace 
apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of 
nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, 
chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. 
That will hugely increase the overhead of all these 
dangerous industries.     That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though 
Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the 
loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off 
socially or economically in the long run.   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-
deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to 
rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters 
would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are 
already on the ropes.    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and 
remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, 
it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  
Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but 
a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  
Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, 
climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope 
never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social 
re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native 
twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, 
first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good 
for the computer industry.  We all need to take the 
dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This 
week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on 
fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests 
around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, 
spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of 
Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the 
sea. I could go on.    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required 
to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful 
method with which to do this, those useful tactics will 
spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe 
they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net 
will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a 
whole series of ubicomp applications across society.    I've been speculating about these new forms of 
ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because 
that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  
We build little scenario worlds and make up names for 
them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but 
there are others.BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  
Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in 
Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military, 
unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic 
commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I 
haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long 
to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-
understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military 
are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't 
be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily 
growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic 
catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational 
help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick 
and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little 
privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... 
if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it 
might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old 
always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket 
be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  
And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale 
prospects of ""K-12.net.""STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban 
systems management.  Water networks, power networks,
subways, sidewalks and so forth.PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison 
population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be 
watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron 
cages now.INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial 
assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the 
biggest application.SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and 
small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, 
but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety 
zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  
It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a 
sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas 
under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing 
some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into 
various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One 
can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new 
and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in 
the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, 
smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops 
within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, 
sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence 
through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique 
like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might 
be a bit underestimated.And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times 
return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I 
take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  
You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky 
stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in 
a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like 
the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.      When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that 
humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has 
been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of 
ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way 
we deal with them, are different.  Different in character, 
different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century 
standards.     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security 
department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony 
up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my 
lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and 
gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  
This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, 
contemporary idea that is really new, really different, 
and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they 
spread across the board of society. I am going to be a 
very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me, 
send some email.Thanks a lot for your attention.O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O

decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern
distributions. However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the
dead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a
flood ?) getting a monitor with a DVI input is best. Of course, you'll need
a DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA
because it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct
connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I've
ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
use DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise,

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 Â“During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic,Â” Mr Bamping said. Â“Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; thereÂ’s more of them.Â” 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societyÂ’s Scottish arm, said: Â“Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I donÂ’t
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.Â” 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

Dear sirs or Madams,
We are one Arcyl bathtub manufacturer in China.-----------------Profile-----------------------Our factoryspecializes in manufacturing ï¿½ï¿½YEMAï¿½ï¿½ brand acrylic composite bathtubs, we have more than 10 years experience of bathtub manufacturing and marketing. With 
our considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range. After several years 
development we produced our current range and the YEMA brand bathtub was patented in 2001. We were even awarded the ""Gold Medal"" in the ""Chinese Patent Technology 
Exhibition"" and ""The Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition"" later that year. The YEMA bathtubs structural design is that of a normal 
acrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material. It is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit, making it more smooth, gentle and 
elegant. This manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub (easily to clean, resistance to dirt, colorful,attractive etc) 
but also provides increased heat retention, and extends the products life span.Besides our products on website, we now produce some new models for USA market. We also produce shower panels with finest quality.-------------------bathtub Specifications---------------------

  SM>       (Sleepycat, Postgres, MySQL, ...)?I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that
BerkeleyDB.  It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend
fewer resources working on database reliability.  On the other hand,
Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB.ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.
You can use our FileStorage or you can use someone else's database,
although BerkeleyDB is the best we can offer at the moment.  (It would

This sounds like a Zope complaint that doesn't have anything to do
with ZODB, but maybe I misunderstand you.  You don't have to store
your code in the database, although that will be mostly possible in
ZODB4.Seriously, ZODB stores object pickles in a database.  The storage
layer is free to manage those pickles however it likes.  FileStorage
uses a single file.  Toby Dickenson's DirectoryStorage represents each
pickle as a separate file.  SM> * It seems to grow without bound, else why do I need to pack my
  SM>       Data.fs file every now and then?It grows without bound unless you pack it.  Why is that a problem? 
BerkeleyDB log files grow without bound, too.  Databases require some
tending.  One possibility with FileStorage is to add an explicit
pack() call to update training operation.  We'd need to think
carefully about the performance impact.  SM> Also, there is the issue of availability.  While it's just an

Quite interesting -- it's pretty similar to the spam phrases stuff.  As
Scott pointed out, this would work quite well as a naive Bayesian system.
(in fact, I think it may be quite close to being one already...)I like the way ""FL"" -- ie. Florida -- is one of the top scoring terms. ;)Also, when I was doing the spam-phrases stuff, I discounted the ff0000

attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them

compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

2054,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.htmlLioness adopts fifth antelopeRory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
the two?I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   
To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. 
I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing 
quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double 
album this year and have been touring in support of that release. 
For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is 
awesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the 
Treo 270, but for what I'll need, 
this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that 
remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's 
use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. I'm also scoping out the 
Palm Markup Language 
(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, 
in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of 
the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content 
organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add 
some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and 
anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

TomeRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25
http://www.tomeraider.com/
Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my 
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy 
to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, 
allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) 
with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. 
The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in 
mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a 
modified set of HTML tags with the  designation for page breaks. The 
only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre 
in the software.Â GnomeFEATURE

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, 
but he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In 
this segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for 
Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, 
you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary 
to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners 
throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary 
pieces with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some 
beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A 
Netherlands native,  who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests 
(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American 
jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native 
English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so 
you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but 
for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a 
fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen  van den Hombergh's talent. A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about

Click for DetailsThe Man Who Wasn't There (R) 2001
Drama - 116min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers CommentaryMuch more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate.

YaST, YaST2, and the associated installer program.So, if one wanted to distribute a version of SuSE free of encumbrances

INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
EVENT
Â Exhibitions India
organises the Convergence 
India Â exhibition & conference, which is the
longest running 
international trade-show and the only forum in India
to showcase the 
convergence of voice and data networks, delivery of content,
television and 
entertainment applications, broadcast, telecommunications,
fixed and mobile 
networks, internet, computing etc.
Â 
Exhibitions India invites
you to participate 
at theÂ 11th Convergence India 2003 exhibition
& 
conference, which will be at Pragati Maidan,
New Delhi, 
India duringÂ 11-13 March
2003.
Â 
The 
Government of India has recently mandated the Conditional
Access System for 
distribution of satellite television channels. This has
created a whole new 
marketplace in the Indian cable industry. Once this bill is
made an act, it will 
be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels
through a set-top 
box.India has an estimated 38
million cable homes! The 
implementation of this change will require massive
investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great 
oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your
products at the 
11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an
opportunity to meet 
all yourÂ  targetted visitors under a
single 
roof.Other
exhibits will be from 
various industries including high speed networking, internet
telephony, mobile 
and satellite communications, network infrastructure, optical
access networking, 
portable communication devices, t&m and interactive
media, VoIP, wireless 
access, 3G, m-commerce, multimedia broadband services via
satellite, conditional 
access technologies, satellite receivers and transmitters,
encoders, decoders, 
and the latest in broadcast, cable and satellite
equipment,Â mobile phone 
accesoriesÂ  etc.We 
successfully concluded the 10th Convergence
India 2002 
exhibition and conference at New Delhi - the event
hadÂ 176 exhibitors from 
17Â countries displaying their equipment and technologies
to a discerning 
audience ofÂ 16,093 visitors from the industry,
government, related trade 
associations. The event got extensive coverage from
theÂ media - both print 
and electronic. The three day high profile conference had
over 1374 delegates. 
Highlights of the event wereÂ country pavilions from
USA, 
FRANCE, CHINA & the
VoIP 
Technology Pavilion.

chocolate flavoured pieces... :)Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)- Matthew[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)

to someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to
contact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be
amazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to
ignore the ""please apply"" messages.As an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the
addressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any
reason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to
send out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an

know, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty
others have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of
them for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which
email addresses are already approved and avoid using others.Plus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email
address from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new
job info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to
tell them about your new job email address? -Mike

did.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing the
data somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spamYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's
done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to
train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients.  That's the ""delete as spam"" button
Paul Graham was talking about.* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the
  opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  ""eggs"".Neale

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   
I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 
Mac OS X Tips is in publication 
and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have 
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
and Randy.I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
topics. Either way, I'm open to some 
AppleScript suggestions.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE
http://www.searchstandard.com/
While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
that much easier.

Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48
http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.htmlDealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
a sound from your machine.
Â GnomeTERMINALFor OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From 
the command line type:sudo chown username filenameYou'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
replace filename.

the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers

trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.Bill

Dear Reader,
Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost 
any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as 
$199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a 
good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive 
models will suit students or home users who need to print letters 
or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. 
In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity 
paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for 
corporate and small-business users. Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer
with the right price and features for you!Brother HL-1440

I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.
On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers

I can do email for the office fairly easily.I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.

2128,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues ""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. ""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

1803,"Hello
 
You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling.
 
I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! 
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely 
NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if 
people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to 
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.
 
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This 
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.
 
2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
 
==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
==================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 
==================================================
 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
==================================================
 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.
 
Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
 
=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old

""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial

http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact/021007fa_factTHE CHAIRMAN	
by NICHOLAS LEMANN
He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
New Yorker, October 8, 2002Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
interests.Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
the public and the pressâ€”encouraged by the players, who speak in jargonâ€”
can't get themselves interested.One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
comedy routine by the commission's chairman.Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifeâ€”telephone 
and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
F.C.C. World's feverish mood (""The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns"") 
and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
just quoted is followed by this explanation: ""The ILECs appear likely to 
enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
market share loss in business lines to CLECs."" It's a lot easier to 
think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.
Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
head of a federal agencyâ€”he is thirty-nineâ€”and genially charming. 
Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
""avid moderate."" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
calls him ""radical and extreme."" Just as often as he's accused of being 
a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
cautious. ""It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,"" 
another former chairman, William Kennard, says. ""You have to have an 
answer."" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
him. ""You don't care about these regulations,"" Hollings said. ""You don't 
care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
job?""""Extremely,"" Powell said, with an amiable smile.
One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
supervisionâ€”its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
terrifying category of interest groupâ€”you can cross the local bank 
president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.
F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
breakup of A.T. & T.â€”by far the biggest and most important company the 
commission regulatedâ€”deposited a thick additional sediment of 
self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
which customers were not permitted to ownâ€”and they were all the same 
company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersâ€”and 
millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a ""natural 
monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total 
control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
prosperous, too.The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
as ""baby Bells"" and to F.C.C. World as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version 
of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
helping to reposition them as the technology partyâ€”the party that 
brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to 
the twenty-first century,"" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
companies, ""see-lecks"" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
see-lecksâ€”companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentâ€”and 
into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
former lieutenants told me, ""Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""
The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
undiscriminating.)By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
Furchtgott-Roth.Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
gave a very Michael Powell speechâ€”whimsical, intellectual, and 
free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)â€”that 
began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
telecom companies alive. ""In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" Powell said. ""Like the 
Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
least, so it is thought."" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
of the Bush Administration.Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
poor health of the long-distance companies.The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
of Viacom.In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
be hyperactiveâ€”the superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
to get new technologyâ€”especially fast Internet connectionsâ€”into the 
homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
expectations and stirred too many passions.)But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
infuriates his criticsâ€”in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital 
divide""â€”that is, economic inequality in access to the Internetâ€”he said, 
""You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
I can't afford one."" At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
somersault.
Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
the market before the factâ€”""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayâ€”should 
wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
then became a protÃ©gÃ© of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
enduring love of law schoolâ€”""It's sort of like a law-school study 
session over there,"" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an 
automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
similar proposition. There are scholars who argueâ€”indeed, the famous 
Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisâ€”that 
spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
of ways that we're accustomed to.""Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act had been excessive.""I would start with a caveat,"" Powell said. ""Look, I can't fault those 
judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
certainly was.""But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
exaggerated expectationâ€”by the leadership of the commission, by 
politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
see numbers go up on the board.""Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. "" 
'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" Now Powell returned 
to being Powell. ""I think that expectation was astonishingly 
unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
model.""How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? ""We could have 
chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" 
Powell said. ""Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.""Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""No, we wouldn't have 
every home in America with competitive choice yetâ€”but we don't anyway. I 
don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.""Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
businesses, either, and they never might. ""Everybody's always saying, 
'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.""Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
stronger? ""At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
dying."" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
gesturesâ€”in August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
up the telecom industry.I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
service. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It concerns us that there's one of each of 
those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" 
Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
""So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
is, Does it stay that way?""The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
which distorts markets. ""If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
know how to do thatâ€”the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
that's ascribed to it sometimes.""Powell explained, ""Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
and then we have policies like""â€”here his tone went from ironic to 
sarcasticâ€”""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""
F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
he regulatesâ€”so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.""This is why elections matter,"" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.â€”much 
more than, say, the war in Afghanistanâ€”is a case in which a Gore 
Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsâ€”the 
long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartsâ€”with their 
friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
unrecognizably different from America's past.

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.1. Navigation SystemDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.2. Color SchemeWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""3. Content WindowThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.4. Font(s)Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.5. AdvertisingAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.    ConclusionThese are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email

 5 Ways to Create a Unique Websiteï¿½ï¿½Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of
identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
design for your website.
1. Navigation System

- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
Â Â Â  gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the

> me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other

Hi,We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.cheers,

4832,"Hello JustinThe simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you
hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at

ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""It is then explained: ""He had paid Â£625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.""In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal Â£10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.""The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.""The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.""The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
issues a call for action.""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.""

Subject: Re: Al Qaeda's Fantasy Ideology
Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on
muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done,
they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it
is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the
world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on
the basis of those imaginings.Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that
anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck.
This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through
consensus.An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in
furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in
furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are
performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much
showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is
this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?What cultural myopia is in play here in the US?I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I
noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi
overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war
preparations (digging bunkers etc).At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on
multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible
preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you
like. Perhaps that's whats at work here.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:

help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for

Our preschoolers (2 and 4) use Winamp with a Pokemon skin.  It's the
2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.What /we/ need is a good ""barely literate"" email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed; even further back there was a DOS shareware editor

certain situations.they are not binding. though there are some situations where for proffessional reasons one
may wish to indicate the standing of an email. (eg legal advice ""this
is / is not legal advice"" type of thing. But again, this means 
disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.See the norwich union case. Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
to see sense:1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
every possible type of client encoding).1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
disclaimer might not be displayed.1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
context (or no disclaimer at all).2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
(dilution, NU case in UK)3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
an actual lawyer.4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
Microsoft (iirc)).Useful link:http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
(and see links at bottom of this page).finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:	""that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? 
	Wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?""> kevinDisclaimer: IANAL, all the above might be wrong, i might even be 
intentionally misleading you. who knows.. go check it out for

Related anecdote:I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.Anecdote number two:In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much
as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.

Darwin streaming media serverhttp://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open StreamingMPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.
Both sound interesting, and low $$.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet.I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.

If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.
    * Boot off the install CD
    * modprobe serial
    * setserial (if needed)
    * create mount point for other distribution
    * mount other distribution
    * chroot'd to other distribution
    * su - to regular user
    * ran wvdial
    * switch consoles and install as normal
And yes I do give better technical support to people who use
distros I like.I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

5089,"""In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of
startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as
it did in the boom year of 1999.""  Oookaaaay...
http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_eeTimes_05-08-02.shtmlIconoclast designers choose MIPS
By Anthony Cataldo
May 28, 2002  SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to
turn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:
tossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.
For those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,
clocks are for wimps.The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an
asynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert
Nunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor
mainstream. ""We really deal with an asynchronous world,"" he said. ""We
only make it synchronous for our own convenience.""This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would
consider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems
designers. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others
like it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS
instruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice
for maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by
fielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp
aren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the
high-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity
Inc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new
spin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then
letting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to
soon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and
consume just 10 to 15 watts.Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as
interesting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked
some of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them
respectability is MIPS.Theirs for the asking One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform
is that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about
licensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the
licensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By
contrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to
just two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two
PowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most
requests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being
FPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of
reduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it
attractive to processor designers interested in extending the
architecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and
software that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming
at PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO
interface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.Good fit ""It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to
add instructions,"" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of
Intrinsity.  ""You also get all the third-party tools that very easily
fit into our base of platforms.""There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In
the mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the
instruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors
took it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this
broke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler
vendors like Green Hills Software Inc.""We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and
it's embarrassing,"" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering
at Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin
also wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded
application binary interface. ""We went to MIPS and said we've done a
dozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,"" he said.MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on
architectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to
live with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. ""To its credit,
MIPS quickly caught on,"" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry
analyst. ""Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are
still haunted by incompatibility among multiples.""If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC
camp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the
PowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and
IBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide
PowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been
reluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up
hurting the PowerPC cause, though.""To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,"" Green Hills'
Franklin said. ""Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a
Japanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another
Japanese company.""Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by
licensing the architecture. ""It's all about software compatibility and
tool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better
you're going to do,"" he said. ""I don't think Motorola and IBM can
address the entire market by themselves.""There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the
process of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve
more licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the
open licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may
have more than just two competitors to worry about.""We're certainly not averse to [licensing],"" said Lisa Su, director of
PowerPC products at IBM. ""The question is, how much do we do and who do
we license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard
core, soft core or licensing the ISA.""But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. ""We know
that if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on
software compatibility,"" Su said. ""With MIPS there's a degree of
fracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other
markets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a
happy medium.""Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip
provider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual
property. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue
is not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from
Xilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the
architecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs
for Xilinx in its own fabs. ""We're not trying to make money off of
licensing,"" Su said.Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC
vendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end
lines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,
still rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design
relatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are
shipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a
four-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a
seven-stage pipe.The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. ""When we
get to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,"" said Raj Handa,
PowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.Proprietary processes Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries
that haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even
though companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside
foundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to
juice up their high-performance devices.Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little
choice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their
chops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how
some of the newer players measure up.Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the
year. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. ""We're going
to shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power
performance,"" Fulcrum's Nunn said. ""We really want to change the way the
world designs semiconductors.""http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtmlThe Pasadena startup machine
By Alison Overholt
April, 2002  There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting
to happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans
between classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?
Plunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in
class. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few
proposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save
one: the California Institute of Technology.In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of
startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as
it did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on
most campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's
Office of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for
cultivating commerce. ""We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs
scientifically more than other schools do,"" says Rich Wolfe, the
office's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the
science itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at
Caltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. ""There is a pervasive
philosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,"" Cummings
says. ""There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be
around. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't
make it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of
it. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out
into industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.""Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with
Caltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an
asynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into
commercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical
aspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require
entrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use
of technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle
entrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to
spare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,
and it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies
are financially secure.For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. ""The reality is that universities
rely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be
collected from the initial licensing process,"" Wolfe says. ""So we seek a
bite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs
founds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a
gift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he
was just getting started.""Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won
about $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in
recent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who
formerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from
their alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design
from technology journals.One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their
degrees. Officially, both are now ""on leave."" They may not be back.----
aDaM@XeNT.CoM
High-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If
you are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,
not one that they want you to do.Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work
with. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a
start-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at
just the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a
success. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture
capitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk
running out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that
probably means the product won't be done. Ever.Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you
need it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you
have used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and
everything you can borrow.Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can
contract out because contractors don't require stock options.As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is
to manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with
fewer shares but more wealth.Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.  -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html

I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.--

through a sendmail milter (smrazor http://www.sapros.com/smrazor/ ) and have
set up my milter timeouts to 20sec connect and 30 sec response. The problem
is that there is another timeout setting for razor-check that I am unable to
locate. My razor-agent.log is now getting filled with :check[6149]: [ 3] Timed out (15 sec) while reading from honor.cloudmark.com.So the question is, is there a razor-agent.conf file setting to increase

Subject: Pop-up ads and the law
Declan:As you know, a district court judge recently entered a preliminary 
injunction against Gator in a lawsuit brought by numerous website news 
publishers over Gator's pop-up advertising service.  In my most recent 
column for The Wall Street Journal Online (now available on GigaLaw.com
at http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/2002/isenberg-2002-08.html), I
examine the potential greater effect of this lawsuit.  For example:
""Terence Ross of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the news publishers' attorney,
even told me that he thinks Internet users who configure their browsers
to disable graphics (a common tactic to boost the speed of Web surfing)
are committing copyright infringement because they are interfering with
Web publishers' exclusive right to control how their pages are
displayed.""Doug Isenberg, Esq.

Â  07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make
more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. We're still sitting
at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier."" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?My good buddy, Bill,
tells me that Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at

{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget
about it."" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...)Recommend It!

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html
{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
    Unearthed by Michael Tretyakovhttp://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

Â GnomeTIPI just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush ViewsBy Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

Have a BLAST in bed,
GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
 Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxamanâ„¢.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxamanâ„¢ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxamanâ„¢
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
 Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.3-8 weeks
 By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.9 weeks +
 After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Â 
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

tissue in the penis, leading to size gains in both length and
thickness.
 Â 
The proprietary blend of herbs
found in Maxamanâ„¢ consists of:Zinc (as zinc oxide) - This essential mineral is required for
protein synthesis and collagen formation. Sufficient intake and
absorption of zinc are needed to maintain a proper concentration of
Vitamin E.Yohimbe - Used traditionally to treat impotence and frigidity,
Yohimbe helps to increase blood flow and sensitivity of nerves,
especially in the pelvic region. It is commonly used as an
aphrodisiac to stimulate sexual organs and improve central nervous
system function.Maca - Maca is an adaptogen. It works to create harmony in the
body, regulating levels of hormones and enzymes to create a state
of homeostasis.Catuaba - Native to Brazil and parts of the Amazon, Catuaba is
a central nervous system stimulant commonly used throughout the
world for treating sexual impotence, exhaustion and fatigue.Muira Puama - A South American herb, Muira Puama has been
used to treat impotence for hundreds of years. It is highly sought
after for its strong stimulant qualities.Oyster Meat - Historically
known as an aphrodisiac, oyster meat contains flavonoids that have
been shown to stimulate the reproductive system.L-Arginine - L-Arginine
is an amino acid which helps to create nitric oxide in the human
body. Nitric oxide is the most essential substance influencing
sexual function in both men and women. Nitric oxide promotes
circulation, resulting in improved blood flow.
 Â Oatstraw - Used to
treat fatigue and exhaustion, Oatstraw improves brain and nervous
system function and has been used to treat impotence. It is
extremely useful for aiding your body in recovering from
exhaustion, as well as correcting sexual debility.Nettle Leaf - Acts as a
diuretic, expectorant and tonic. It is rich in iron and chlorophyll
to clean and nourish the blood.
Cayenne - Cayenne improves
circulation, increases the metabolic rate and acts as a catalyst
for other herbs.
Pumpkin Seed - Pumpkin seed is
commonly used to strengthen the prostate gland and promote male
hormone function. Myosin, an amino acid found in pumpkin seeds, is
known to be essential for muscular contractions.Sarsaparilla - Found along
the coast of Peru, Sarsaparilla aids in the production of
testosterone and progesterone.Orchic Substance - This is an
extract from bovine testes, and is proven to increase testosterone
levels without harmful steroids.Licorice Root - Licorice root fights inflammation, as well as
viral, bacterial and parasitic infection. Licorice cleanses the
colon, and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal
lining.Tribulus - A natural testosterone enhancer, Tribulus can
improve desire and performance and increase sexual energy. Tribulus
is also an excellent circulatory and heart tonic and can help
dilate arteries. In India it is used as a tonic for the urinary
system.Ginseng Blend (Siberian, American & Korean) - Commonly used by athletes for overall body strengthening,
Ginseng fortifies the adrenal gland, and promotes healthy
circulation. It increases the conversion rate of sugars into the
necessary substrates for the formation of fatty acids in the liver.
Ginseng stimulates the central nervous system, and is a quick
antidote for fatigue.
Astragalus - Regarded as a potent
tonic for increasing energy levels and stimulating the immune
system, Astragalus has also been employed effectively as a
diuretic.Boron
- Boron helps to prevent the loss of calcium, phosphorus and
magnesium through the urine.

sound card.Despite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on

---------------------------------------------------------------------~->A new version of unison is now available for testing.  It incorporates
several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to
a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for
the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more
than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel.  These users are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.  Others can wait if they wish.The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but
not Windows.  (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at
the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison
on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly
for building executables for export.)Grab it from here:
   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.htmlEnjoy,        -- Benjamin   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#..unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:
  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common  common.prf =
      
       Now do  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types ) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding
            -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
             should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument  will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison- instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                 ignore = 
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                 ignore = Regexp 
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                 ignore = Name 
       matches any path in which one component matches , while                 ignore = Path 
       matches exactly the path .
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and
       :
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.
       
Changes in Version 2.9.20   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#..unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:
  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common  common.prf =
      
       Now do  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types ) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding
            -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
             should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument  will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison- instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                 ignore = 
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                 ignore = Regexp 
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                 ignore = Name 
       matches any path in which one component matches , while                 ignore = Path 
       matches exactly the path .
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and
       :
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.

Â  07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT 
Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.I'm off to the 
Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeDOWNLOADS

http://www.thumpbunny.com/Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes 
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to 
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two 
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring 
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.Â GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.Buy One Inkjet Cartridge - GET TWO FREE!!

Â GnomeTIPTraditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.Tip by Jake

all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of

# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an

itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of

http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter RojasPeter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
Â£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

More like Apple's implementation - the Gconf2 files are bog-standard 
XML, should you feel tempted to edit it by hand :)There are some possibilities that using standardised configuration tools 
provide: the ability to centrally manage a large number of computers - 
something like Windows' group policy. Although that would require other 
applications to use GConf as well .Haven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the 
fact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB 
ADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have 
to do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it 
for its config tools.Regards,Michel__________________________________________________

Will surprise you, though we do not know, 
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for

Release Notes for libpng 
ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files.The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
leaks in reading image functions.Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
from the Ximian FTP site:Solaris 7/8

I _think_ you need to install postgreql-odbc and its' dependencies. Then
probably a bit of configuration to open a port to the network. But
Matthias is right, this is not the right place for this question.To bring things back on topic, I was practicing my ""rpmbuild'n skillz""
and made an rpm with some simple software tools to drive my DVD+RW
burner. No GUI frontend, but it works just fine from the command line. I

I remember not so long ago when eircom was put
on the ORBS list, half the ISP's in Europe wouldn't
accept mail from my address. Of course, informing
Eircom of this did nothing for about 4 months or so.IMHO stopping spammers is a great idea but I'd rather
have to hit d or delete rather than have my messages
bounced by someone else's ISP.Regards,

> DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
> ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer
> August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
> 
> DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
> specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
> process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes 
> the data in 
> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater 
> performance, 
> according to company officials.
> 
> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the 
> first in a 
> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based 
> startup. The 
> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
> data.
> 
> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
> between two 
> businesses.
> 
> ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
> ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
> 
> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
> file size up 
> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
> alternative.
> 
> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
> importance in the world of XML.
> 
> ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
> said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
> Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
> 
> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
> 
> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
> the company 
> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
> regards to speed 
> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
> 
> ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
> he believes 
> will be mostly false.
> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
> of a packet, 
> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
> 1,400 bytes 
> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
> 
> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
> collection of 
> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
> markup language 
> as they pass through the device.
> 
> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
> will identify 
> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
> 
> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
> application 
> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
> more granular 
> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
> controls the device.
> 
> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging 
> market. Startup 
> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega 
> XPE switch in 
> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, 
> launched with a 
> focus on content processing and acceleration.
> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at 
> $54,995. The 
> company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
> field trails at a number of other enterprises.

source-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their
distribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms
to someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any
reasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.

SuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you
down to a judge, if that's what you're asking.> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not

work to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if
you've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather
imprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works
under diverse licence terms collected onto some media.In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate
and redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the
applications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are
proprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,
duplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is
copyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the
GNU GPL is going to change that.(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and
""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for
value"".)If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.> What does the GPL mean now?Suggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.--

Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. Register for Gnomedex today!   My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my
father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail
exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news
came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:
""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of
a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like
a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal
with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone
actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she
had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't
interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see
me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to
Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a
few months ago:
""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at
the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines
last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite
being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last
minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again
being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email
publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a
friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their
Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you
get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I
have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.
It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.""
I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and
found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.
Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized
that Jake was offering his Converting
Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was
taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them
were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a
problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out
the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please
look again). A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In
fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple
machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use
Dreamweaver.
Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly
newsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage
you to give it another glance. After all, as Elwood
Edwards so finely said: You've
Got Lockergnome! Thanks to David
Lawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your
name, too. And yes, that's the AOL guy.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Online BrandingThe Evidence is Against You
Scribbled by Jim GirardEvery time some new technology has expanded free access to popular
music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the
1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it
would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in
increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the
advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed
by the music industry as different from previous such
developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to
create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual
result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music
industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became
more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD
technology).The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -
 and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of
songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be
instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the
server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the
phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused
on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,
and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've
limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -
 and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to
avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright
is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think
of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,
you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with
the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove
away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be
entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you
are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for
the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a
copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products
whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like ""Coke"" or
""Kleenex"" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to
do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a
great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some
point could start using the word on their own product, arguing
that it is in the public domain.The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually
stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they
know from long experience, increases their sales because most of
the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with
near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the
cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the
cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the
first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at
establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,
in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a
legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.
The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is
the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a
few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for
if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to
make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it
requires charging far more for an individual song that most people
are willing to pay.At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of
civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to
the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly
directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and
case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most
technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a
simple moral or criminal issue. ""Common sense"" tells a lot of
people that copying music without paying for it is just like
stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if
common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have
the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual
systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large
part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the
case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those
systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that
most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any
time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an
issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a
matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what
he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you
believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't
be paying him as much as he is.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking? Have you ever wanted to write an e-book?

Smith: ""Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail
users who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service
wanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive
my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful
when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble
here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an
error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,
copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),
then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the
control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;
%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.
The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a
character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the
percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which
translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come
up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?""Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020712.html

   barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter

   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
   to the former and kill two birds with one
   stone?but not:India: in which the muslims and hindus were
    originally intermixed to some degree,
    but Partioned due to their own conflict,
    not due to English resettlement policy.Canada: in which the french and english were
    already established, and it was just the
    balance of power on the continent that
    determined events in the colonies.  The
    Acadians got resettled, but they don't
    seem to have been that good for picking
    fights with their neighbors, so no one
    had them plonked down next door.-Dave* this works best with a populace who,

  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE"" by buying at up to 95%
  below wholesale and selling at 100 to 500%+ over your cost ?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.
Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with job security. We all need a backup
  plan.If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.

3203,"BlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: 
LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom:         daev 
Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood...
The Irish Digest July 1964
The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600Bob,This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
thought out.Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
a vacuum.Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
it without wheels, drive train, etc.But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?

           Product: Spamassassin

          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other

        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).===============The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total.OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME

have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.  0.450    1.418    0.000    1.00    0.78    0.01  T_HTML_CONSEC_IMGS06

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

The report is placed inside of the mime boundary:

Email: ronardtony@mail.com
Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- (a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang (b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship. Regards,
RONARD TONY.

4769,"hey,AFAIK it isn't hard at all to create
your own modified version of the redhat
distro.  There's even a tarball[1] with this
specifically in mind.  The people who built
the Ximian version of RedHat used a system
similar to said tarball.Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports
system rather than rpm, deb or whatever
would complicate things a tad more IMHO.It *is* a good idea though.  I've been 
wondering about the same thing for a couple
of months now but always considered it too
complicated to carry out. (If that makes any
sense at all).I don't discount any other work like for 
example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe
there is general interest in an Irish distro.
Anyone?Regards,

How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.
Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring
 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.Just a pseudo random thought.
I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

The online content business.Dear Friends,The online content business is doing fantastic.
Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With 
advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.
However,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 U.S.  consumers spent $675 millionÂ on paidÂ online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online
Publishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  Look at these success stories:
New York Times Digital has 
been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and 
registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.
TheStreet.com brought over 
$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent 
over the year-ago quarter.
ConsumerReports.com will 
reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.
RealNetworks' consumer multi-media 
subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 
million in the last quarter.
The Wall Street Journal Online
added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber
base to 646,000.
FT.com has signed up 17,000 
subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.
In recognition of this trend we're hosting 
the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 
2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free 
to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.
Our previous Content Management 
Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City 
and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.
The Content Management Summit 
III,  taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, 
2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and 
distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical 
solutions.
The event will feature presentations 
from software and services companies providing services
and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.
We're thrilled that 
Microsoft,  TeleKnowledge,  eMeta,  and Liquify will all be demonstrating 
their latest products and services.
The event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.
 These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges
facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since
the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  The panels will
feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive
question and answer session with the audience.
Among the round table topics will be:
Weblogs:  how they are affecting big media 
companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.
Financial news and information 
companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, 
and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.
Business information services 
such as Hoovers,  Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, 
 niche product launches and revenue streams.
Daily news/newspaper companies 
publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards
paid content and its implications,  among other issues.
Consumer and entertainment 
publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, 
 the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.
Join us on October 10th 
for this very important event.  If you are directly responsible 
for content management at a major content site you may qualify for 
a VIP ticket.  Please e-mail your request with your name,  title and bio to
invite@cmsummit.com.  If you are
with a software or services provider,  or anyone not directly responsible 
for the purchase of content management software or solutions,  you can purchase 
a ticket to this event for $1,200 at invite@cmsummit.com.

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msecFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
user settings hasn't changed.Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?/Anders_______________________________________________

them from www.starcd.com anyway. They use some sort of
listening and recognition technology to identify the music played

JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
E-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com
ATTN:ALHAJIWith due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the ï¿½(ECOMOG)ï¿½
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
sonï¿½s name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.
I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.
Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.
Best regard,MRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.

Here is my recipe for Maildrop:# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE""
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
  xfilter ""reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'""
  log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""
  to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/""
}I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.HTH,

  Oops.
Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting in the other
reader hanging around forever.... not realising that never-opened-for-reading
and opened-and-later-closed might be different.  Sensible behaviour has now been
observed.

mpeg2enc generates stats during the run, so I give each one an xterm.Thanks,

all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who
verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work.Matthias--

be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
